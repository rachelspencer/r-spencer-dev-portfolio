## Set up the project

### Installation Instructions

`npm` is distributed with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get `npm` installed on your computer. You can install Node by [downloading it from the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) or using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on a macOS or Linux device or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) on a Windows device.

You can check if you have Node.js already installed by running `node -v` in your terminal. You will need it for this project to run, so don't skip this!

You will also need to make sure you have Visual Studios installed, check by running `code --version`. If you don't have it [download it from VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). If you use another development 
environment, you will need to alter setp 7. to open the cloned repo. 

### Clone the project locally

1. Click on the "Code" tab on this repo's "Code" page.
2. Click the green "Code" button to reveal a "Clone" popup.
3. The "HTTPS" tab should be automatically selected. If not, click "HTTPS."
4. Click the copy button to copy the url of this repository to your clipboard.

5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory you'd like to save this repository.
6. When you are in the right location, run `git clone` and paste the url copied from step 4.
7. To open this repo locally, navigate inside of the repo directory and run `code .`. If you have Visual Studios installed, this
   will open a new window with this code in it.

## Usage Guidelines

In the root of the directory you will need to run `npm i` in the terminal to install the projects dependencies. In the root you can also run `npm start` to run the server locally.
